This repository works as a mailing list. Watch the changes, (button at the top-right side of the page). I post summaries of the papers I read or information about the blogs I like. All this would be sent to your mail.

This is more of a remind me of the paper I have read. Go to [issues](https://github.com/nishnik/Paper-Leaf/issues) for previously read papers.
